## Description
Attempted to create a functioning tech blog utilizing the MVC paradigm.  I unfortunately ran out of time while attempting to recreate the app that had been posted in the boot camp repo, and therefore am only able to submit what I was able to complete. I also was unable to post to Heroku since the app is unfinished and wasn't working properly at this time.
